## Getting started with the development:
- Clone the repo from GitHub via GitHub Desktop:
clone https://github.com/JohanLossius/SemProj2-Pebbles.git
If you are using GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio Code editor, simply launch and install it via GitHub Desktop by pulling it from the GitHub repo and follow the instructions of the program until you're setup in Visual Studio Code.

**OR**

- You can also pull it directly into VS code from GitHub by adding:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/JohanLossius/SemProj2-Pebbles.git
```

And then pull it:
```
git pull origin main
```

And then install it:
```
npm i
```
## Technologies & styling
This project was built with
- Vanilla javascript
- SASS v1.69.5
- Bootstrap v5.3.2

## Running the project
Ensure all live servers are closed.
Open live server, reccommended using visual studio built-in extension.
Can also use 
```
npm run start
```
to use installed live-server package.

Run 
```
npm run build
```
for any SASS custom styling changes.

Have tried continuously making the automatic "watch" command work, to no avail so far. Kindly provide advice for how to solve this if you know.

## Contributing
For making technical contributions to Pebbles you are well off by focusing on the best practices of modern frontend development and UX/UI design.
Write code that is logical in its syntax, and well structured so that it makes sense and provides clarity, simply by reading it.
Also ensure simple documentation throughout when purposeful, but not just for the sake of doing it.
