## Getting started with the development:
Clone the repo from GitHub via GitHub Desktop:

## Technologies & styling
This project was built with:
- Vanilla Javascript
- SASS v1.69.5
- Bootstrap v5.3.2

## Running the project
Ensure all live servers are closed.
Open live server, reccommended using visual studio built-in extension.
Can also use the following to run the installed live-server package.

**Run:**
```
npm run start
```

**Run:** 
```
npm run build
```
... for any SASS custom styling changes.

Have tried continuously making the automatic "watch" command work, to no avail so far. Kindly provide advice for how to solve this if you know.

## Concept of Pebbles
Pebbles is meant to be a playful brand that exemplifies creativity yet delivering great value and quality for its users.
Some of the best ideas are often quite strange when you hear about them - but that's how the world is changed - by people daring to think differently.
Keep this in mind while working on Pebbles - dare to explore, experiment, and build incredible user experiences bassed in the insights learned from this.

## Contributing
For making technical contributions to Pebbles you are well off by focusing on the best practices of modern frontend development and UX/UI design.
Write code that is logical in its syntax, and well structured so that it makes sense and provides clarity, simply by reading it.
Also ensure simple documentation throughout when purposeful, but not just for the sake of doing it.
