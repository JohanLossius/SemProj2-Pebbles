To get started:
  Clone repository and run "npm i" to get started.

  Ensure all live servers are closed.
  Open live server, reccommended using visual studio built-in extension.
  Can also use "npm run start" to use installed live-server package.

  Run "npm run build" for any SASS custom styling changes.
  Have tried continuously making the automatic "watch" command work, to no avail so far. Kindly provide advice for how to solve this if you know.
